# Tableau-Bar-Graph

I created this chart for Maimonides Hospital by importing data from the The Patient Survey (HCAHPS) â€“ Hospital survey at https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/dgck-syfz and filtering the data for Maimonides Medical Center and the HCAHPS question measures included in the chart. I created a bar chart showing the patient satisfaction survey results for Maimonides Hospital and the New York State average score for each measure.
