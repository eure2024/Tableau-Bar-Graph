# Tableau-Bar-Graph

I created a data visualization for Maimonides Hospital by importing data from the The Patient Survey (HCAHPS) â€“ Hospital survey at https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/dgck-syfz and filtering the data for Maimonides Medical Center and three patient satisfaction survey measures. 

I created a bar chart to show the patient satisfaction survey results for Maimonides Hospital and the New York State average for each measure.
